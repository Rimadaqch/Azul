# Azul OCR: AI-Powered OCR for Tifinagh  

Azul OCR is a project aimed at developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for the Tifinagh script.This project seeks to digitize and preserve handwritten Amazigh texts with high accuracy.  

---

## üìú **Project Overview**  
### **Problematique**  
Tifinagh, the Amazigh script, has limited OCR solutions, making the digitization of handwritten texts challenging. Current OCR tools, such as Tesseract and Paddle OCR, face difficulties in adapting to Tifinagh's unique structure, leading to suboptimal performance.  

### **Objectives**  
- Develop a dedicated OCR system for handwritten Tifinagh.  
- Utilize a hybrid model for feature extraction and sequence modeling.  
- Innovate through a comparative analysis of existing tools and a custom model tailored for Tifinagh.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Methodology**  
### **Steps Followed**  
1. **Exploration and Analysis**:  
   - Studied existing OCR technologies (Tesseract and Paddle OCR).  
   - Conducted a comparative study to evaluate their performance on Tifinagh script.  

2. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Dataset: Tifinagh AMHCD (Handwritten Character Dataset).  
   - Augmented data using transformations such as rotation, noise addition, and scaling.  

3. **Model Development**:  
   - Implemented a hybrid architecture for visual feature extraction and  for character sequence understanding.  

4. **Evaluation and Optimization**:  
   - Compared the performance of Tesseract, Paddle OCR, and the hybrid model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
